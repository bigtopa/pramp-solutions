Merging 2 Packages

Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array arr of item weights, 
implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. 
Your function should return a pair [i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. 
If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.


input:  arr = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16],  lim = 21

output: [3, 1] # since these are the indices of the
               # weights 6 and 15 whose sum equals to 21
